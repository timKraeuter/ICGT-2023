\begin{abstract}
The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard notation for defining intra- and inter-organizational workflows.
However, the informal description of the BPMN execution semantics leads to different interpretations of BPMN features and difficulties in checking behavioral properties.
In this paper, we propose a formalization of the execution semantics of BPMN that, compared to existing approaches, covers more BPMN features while allowing property checking.
Our approach is based on a higher-order transformation from BPMN models to graph transformation systems.
As proof of concept, we have implemented our approach in an open-source web-based tool.

\section{Introduction}
%\gls*{bpmn} \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013} is a widely used standard notation to define intra- and inter-organizational workflows.
%However, the informal description of the BPMN execution semantics leads to different interpretations of BPMN features and difficulties in checking behavioral properties \cite{corradiniFormalApproachAnalysis2021}.
%One can detect errors and optimization potential in process models already during creation by checking behavioral properties.
%Thus, the cost of business process automation using \gls*{bpmn} can be reduced.
%Consequently, we propose a formalization that covers most of the \gls*{bpmn} features used in practice and supports checking behavioral properties.
%
%Suggestion
%
In today's fast-paced business environment, organisations with complex workflows require a powerful means to accurately map, analyse, and optimize their processes. 
\gls*{bpmn} \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013} is widely used standard to define these workflows.
However, the informal description of the BPMN execution semantics leads to different interpretations of BPMN features and difficulties in checking behavioral properties \cite{corradiniFormalApproachAnalysis2021}.
Formalizing \gls*{bpmn} would reduce the cost of business process automation drastically by facilitating the detection of errors and optimization potentials in process models already during design time. 
To this end, we propose a formalization that covers most of the \gls*{bpmn} features used in practice and supports checking behavioral properties.

Generally, we think about two fundamental concepts when formalizing the execution semantics of a behavioral language.
First, \textit{state structure}, i.e., how models are represented during execution.
The state structure corresponds to the typegraph in \gls*{gt} systems.
Second, \textit{state-changing elements}, i.e., which elements in a model encode state changes.
These elements are implemented using \gls*{gt} rules.
In our approach, we create \gls*{gt} rules based on a \gls*{hot}, as shown in \autoref{fig:approach}.

% Describe the approach and highlight that it can be generalized to other languages with state and state-changing elements.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/bpmn_semantics-overview.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the approach}
    \label{fig:approach}
\end{figure}

%First, a modeler defines a BPMN model and behavioral properties to check.
%The BPMN model conforms to the BPMN metamodel defined in the BPMN specification \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}.
%Using the BPMN metamodel, we define the state structure for BPMN in a so-called BPMN execution metamodel, fulfilling the role of a language engineer.
%Usually, an execution metamodel is defined by extending the structural metamodel.
%
%suggestions
To begin the BPMN modeling process, a modeler first defines the BPMN model and its corresponding behavioral properties for evaluation. This model must adhere to the BPMN metamodel as outlined in the BPMN specification by the Object Management Group \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}. To create the state structure for BPMN, the BPMN execution metamodel is defined by language engineers, utilizing the BPMN metamodel as a foundation. Typically, an execution metamodel is created by extending the structural BPMN metamodel.

Furthermore, we define a \gls*{hot} from BPMN models to \gls*{gt} systems.
We call the transformation \textit{higher-order} since the resulting graph-transformation systems represent model-transformations themselves \cite{tisiUseHigherOrderModel2009}.
The \gls*{hot} creates a \gls*{gt} system, i.e., \gls*{gt} rules and a start graph for a given BPMN model.
It is defined using so-called rule generation templates, which describe how \gls*{gt} rules should be generated for each state-changing element in BPMN (see \autoref{sec:formalization}).
The obtained \gls*{gt} system conforms to the execution type graph representing the BPMN execution metamodel interpreted as a type graph.
In the figure, we have colored both artifacts blue to visualize that they contain the same information.
%Finally, we check the previously defined behavioral properties using Groove to run the \gls*{gt} system.
%Suggestion
Ultimately, we use Groove as an execution engine for the \gls*{gt} system and to check the behavioral properties that were defined earlier.

% We implemented our approach in an open-source web-based tool such that it is easily accessible without installation.
% Furthermore, our approach is general since it can be used to formalize other behavioral languages.
% To formalize the execution semantics of a different behavioral language, one only needs to define a new execution metamodel and \gls*{hot} (see language engineer in \autoref{fig:approach})
%Suggestion
Our approach has been incorporated into a user-friendly, open-source web-based tool, which can be accessed without the need for installation. 
Additionally, our approach is versatile as it can be applied to formalize other behavioral languages as well. 
To define the execution semantics of an alternate behavioral language, one simply needs to establish a new execution metamodel and \gls*{hot} (see the language engineer in \autoref{fig:approach}).


% Paper outline
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
First, in \autoref{sec:preliminaries}, we introduce \gls*{bpmn} and point out the theoretical background of this contribution.
Second, we describe the \gls*{bpmn} semantics formalization using the \gls*{hot} (\autoref{sec:formalization}) before explaining how this can be utilized for model checking general BPMN and custom properties (\autoref{sec:modelChecking}).
Then, in \autoref{sec:impl}, we present the web-based tool implementing our approach and benchmark the implementation.
Finally, we discuss related work regarding BPMN feature coverage in \autoref{sec:relatedWork} and conclude in \autoref{sec:conclusion}.

%Suggestion

In this section, we will briefly introduce the execution semantics of BPMN, and readers are encouraged to consult \cite{freundRealLifeBPMNUsing2019} or the BPMN specification \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013} for more in-depth information. 
Furthermore, our application of \gls*{gt}s to formalize the execution semantics of BPMN will be outlined in addition to a brief overview of the theoretical principles that underlie our use of \gls*{gt}s.



\subsection{BPMN}
\autoref{fig:bpmnMetamodel} depicts the structure of BPMN models with the corresponding concrete syntax BPMN symbols contained in clouds.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/bpmn_semantics-bpmn-metamodel.pdf}
  \caption{Excerpt of the BPMN metamodel \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}}
  \label{fig:bpmnMetamodel}
\end{figure}

A BPMN model is represented by a \textsf{Collaboration} that has \textsf{participants} and \textsf{MessageFlows} between \textsf{InteractionNodes}.
Each participant is a \textsf{Process} containing \textsf{FlowNodes} connected by \textsf{SequenceFlows}.
A \textsf{FlowNode} is either an \textsf{Activity}, \textsf{Gateway}, or \textsf{Event}.
Many types of \textsf{Activities}, \textsf{Gateways}, and \textsf{Events} exist.
Activities represent certain tasks to be carried out during a process, while events may happen during the execution of these tasks.
Furthermore, gateways model conditions, parallelizations, and synchronizations \cite{freundRealLifeBPMNUsing2019}.

% BPMN semantics: Token distribution
The BPMN execution semantics is described using the concept of \textit{tokens} \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}, which can be located at sequence flows and specific flow nodes.
Tokens are consumed and created by flow nodes according to the connected sequence flows.
%Thus, the flow nodes are 
The \textsf{FlowNode} is colored purple in \autoref{fig:bpmnMetamodel} since it represents a state-changing element of BPMN as described in \autoref{sec:formalization}.

A BPMN process is triggered by one of its start events, leading to the creation of a token at the triggered start event.
% Activities
Activities can start when at least one token is on an incoming sequence flow.
The start of an activity will move the incoming token to the activity.
When an activity finishes, it deletes its token and adds one at each outgoing sequence flow.
% Gateways
Furthermore, different gateway types exist, such as parallelization, synchronization, XOR, and OR distribution of tokens.
% Events (basic)
Events delete and add tokens like activities but have additional semantics depending on their type.
For example, message events will add or delete messages.

\subsection{Theoretical background}
We use typed attributed graphs for the formalization of the BPMN execution semantics.
Each state, i.e., token distribution during the execution of a BPMN model, is represented as an attributed graph typed by the BPMN execution type graph, which is introduced in \autoref{sec:formalization}.

% Groove uses the single pushout approach with negative application conditions.
Regarding \gls*{gt}, we utilize the single-pushout (SPO) approach with negative application conditions (NAC) \cite{ehrigALGEBRAICAPPROACHESGRAPH1997}, as implemented in Groove \cite{rensinkGROOVESimulatorTool2004}.
In addition, we utilize \textit{nested rules} with quantification to make parts of a rule applied repeatedly or optionally \cite{rensinkNestedQuantificationGraph2006,rensinkHowMuchAre2017}.
Moreover, we utilize NACs to implement more intricate parts in the BPMN execution semantics, such as the termination of processes.


\section{BPMN semantics formalization} \label{sec:formalization}

%Since our approach is based on a \gls*{hot} from BPMN to \gls*{gt} systems, we generate a \textit{start graph} and \textit{\gls*{gt} rules} for each given BPMN model.
The approach supports the BPMN features depicted in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}.
These BPMN features are divided into \textsf{Events}, \textsf{Gateways}, \textsf{Activities}, and \textsf{Edges}.
\textsf{Events} and \textsf{Activities} are further divided into subgroups.
%Due to space limitations, we only explain how the features marked with a green background are realized in this paper.
%However, the other features are also implemented and tested \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.
%Suggestion
Although all these features have been implemented and tested (see \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}), due to space limitations, we only explain the realization of the features marked with a green background.
In the following, first we define the BPMN execution metamodel to represent the BPMN state structure, then we explain our formalization of the features in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}.


\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{images/bpmn_semantics-feature-overview.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the supported BPMN features (structure adapted from \cite{houhouFirstOrderLogicVerification2022})}
    \label{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}
\end{figure}


\subsection{BPMN execution metamodel}

% Our formalization of BPMN is token-based, as in the informal description of the BPMN specification \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}.
%Suggestion
In our formalization of BPMN, we utilize a token-based representation of the execution semantics, which is similar to the approach used in the informal description of the BPMN specification \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}.
% Thus, t
To describe processes holding tokens during execution, we use the execution metamodel shown in \autoref{fig:typeGraph}, depicted as a UML class diagram.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/bpmn_semantics-typegraph.pdf}
  \caption{BPMN execution metamodel}
  \label{fig:typeGraph}
\end{figure}

We use \textsf{ProcessSnapshot} to denote a running BPMN process with a specific token distribution that describes one state in the history of the process execution.
Every \textsf{ProcessSnapshot} has a set of \textsf{tokens}, incoming \textsf{messages}, and \textsf{subprocesses}.
A \textsf{ProcessSnapshot} has the state \textsf{Terminated} if it has no \textsf{tokens} or \textsf{subprocesses}.
Otherwise, it has the state \textsf{Running}.
A \textsf{Token} has an \textsf{elementID}, which points to the BPMN \textsf{Activity} or the \textsf{SequenceFlow} at which it is located.
A \textsf{Message} has an \textsf{elementID} pointing to a \textsf{MessageFlow}.
To concisely depict graphs conforming to this type graph, we introduce a concrete syntax in the clouds attached to the elements.
Our concrete syntax extends the BPMN syntax by adding process snapshots, subprocess relations, tokens, and messages.
Tokens are represented as colored circles drawn at their specified positions in a model.
In addition, we use colored circles at the top left of the bounding box, representing instances of the BPMN \textsf{Process}; these circles represent process snapshots.
The token's color must match the color of the process snapshot holding the token.
The concrete syntax was inspired by the bpmn-js-token-simulation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation}}.


The execution metamodel is a UML class diagram without operations, which can be seen as an attributed type graph with inheritance \cite{heckelGraphTransformationSoftware2020}.
Using execution metamodel as the type graph, we can now define how the start graph and graph-transformation rules for the different BPMN features are created.

Since our approach is based on a \gls*{hot} from BPMN to \gls*{gt} systems, we generate a \textit{start graph} and \textit{\gls*{gt} rules} for each given BPMN model.
The generation of the start graph for a BPMN model is straightforward.
First, for each process in the BPMN model, we generate a process snapshot if the process contains a none start event (NSE).
An NSE describes a start event without a trigger (none).
Then, we add a token to the respective process snapshot for each NSE.
An example of a start graph is shown in \autoref{fig:startGraph} using abstract and concrete syntax.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/startGraph.pdf}
    \caption{Example start graph in abstract (left) and concrete syntax (right)}
    \label{fig:startGraph}
\end{figure}

The \gls*{hot} generates one or more \gls*{gt} rules for each \textsf{FlowNode}, i.e., state-changing element in a BPMN model.
In order to provide a better understanding of the transformation process, we will begin by presenting two example results, namely the generated rules for an NSE and a task (as shown in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}).
Following this, we will delve into an explanation of how our \gls*{hot} creates these rules as well as others.

\autoref{fig:gtRuleAbstract} depicts an example \gls*{gt} rule ($L \to R$) for an NSE in abstract syntax.
The rule is straightforward, moving a token from the start event to its outgoing sequence flow.
For the rest of the paper, we will depict all rules in the concrete syntax introduced earlier.
The rule from \autoref{fig:gtRuleAbstract} depicted in concrete syntax is shown on the left in \autoref{fig:gtRuleConcrete}, 
while the right rule  represents the start of a task, which will move one token from the incoming sequence flow to the task itself.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/rule_abstract.pdf}
  \caption{Example \gls*{gt} rule for an NSE (abstract syntax)}  \label{fig:gtRuleAbstract}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/rule_concrete.pdf}
  \caption{Example \gls*{gt} rule for an NSE (left) and to start a task (right) in concrete syntax}
  \label{fig:gtRuleConcrete}
\end{figure}

To summarize, we described two example rules and introduced a concrete syntax to depict them concisely and understandably.
In the following subsections, we use this concrete syntax to describe how these rules and rules for other flow nodes are generated by our \gls*{hot}.
Elements of the \gls*{hot} are depicted using rule generation templates that describe how specific rules are created for various flow nodes.
We only explain rule generation for (i) process instantiation and termination, (ii) activities and subprocesses, (iii) gateways, as well as (iv) message events due to space constraints.
However, our implementation covers all BPMN features shown in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview} \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.


\subsection{Process instantiation and termination} \label{subsec:instAndTermination}

\autoref{fig:startAndEndTemplate} depicts the rule generation templates for start and end events (\textsf{NSE} and \textsf{NEE} in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}).
All rule generation templates show a state-changing element (\textsf{FlowNode}) with surrounding flows in the left column and the applicable rule generation template in the right column.
The left column shows instances of the BPMN metamodel (\autoref{fig:bpmnMetamodel}), and the right column shows the generated rules typed by the BPMN execution metamodel (see \autoref{fig:typeGraph}).
If more than one rule is generated from a \textsf{FlowNode}, an expression defines how each rule is generated.
For example, the expression $\forall \text{sf} \in \text{E.incSFs}$ for the rule generation template of end events (see \autoref{fig:startAndEndTemplate}) generates one rule for each incoming sequence flow \textit{sf} of the end event \textit{E}.
We use ``.'' in expressions to navigate along the associations of the BPMN metamodel shown in \autoref{fig:bpmnMetamodel}.
In the example, \textsf{E.incSFs} means following all \textsf{incSFs} links for a \textsf{FlowNode} object, resulting in a set of \textsf{SequenceFlow} objects.



\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/start_end_template.pdf}
    \caption{Rule generation templates for start and end events}
    \label{fig:startAndEndTemplate}
\end{figure}

% Start Event + Refer to the start graph.
The start event rule template generates the start event rule in \autoref{fig:gtRuleConcrete}.
The tokens located on the start events are deleted by start event rules, while one token for each outgoing sequence flow is added.
If a start event has more than one outgoing sequence flow, it functions as an \textit{implicit parallel gateway}, forking the control flow by creating one token for each of the sequence flows.
Initially, the tokens on the start events are given by the start graph of the \gls*{gt} system (see, e.g., \autoref{fig:startGraph}).
    
% End Event
The generated end event rules delete tokens one by one for each incoming sequence flow.
However, they do not terminate processes.
% General termination rule
Process termination is implemented with a generic rule---independent of the input BPMN model---which is applicable to all process snapshots.
The termination rule in \autoref{fig:terminationRule} is automatically generated once during the \gls*{hot}.
The rule changes the state of the process snapshot from running to terminated if it has neither tokens nor subprocesses.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/terminate_groove.png}
    \caption{Termination rule in Groove}
    \label{fig:terminationRule}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Activities \& Subprocesses}

% Normal activities
\autoref{fig:activityTemplates} depicts the rule generation templates for activities and subprocesses (see \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}).
Activity execution is divided into two steps implemented by two rule templates.
The upper template generates one rule for each incoming sequence flow to start the activity.
An activity can be started using a token positioned at any of its incoming sequence flows.
Thus, multiple incoming sequence flows represent an \textit{implicit exclusive gateway} (see exclusive gateway in \autoref{fig:gatewayTemplates}).
This rule template generates the sample rule in the right of \autoref{fig:gtRuleConcrete}.

The bottom rule template generates one rule that ends the activity.
It deletes a token at the activity and adds one at each outgoing sequence flow.
Like start events, this implicitly encodes a parallel gateway (see \autoref{fig:gatewayTemplates}). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/activities_template.pdf}
    \caption{Rule generation template for activities and subprocesses}
    \label{fig:activityTemplates}
\end{figure}

% Subprocesses/Call activities
Subprocess execution is like activity execution.
The upper template generates one rule for each incoming sequence flow.
The rule deletes an incoming token and adds a process snapshot representing a subprocess. 
The created process snapshot is represented with a colored circle on the top left corner of the subprocess with a token at each of its start events.
There is a \textit{subprocess} link between the process snapshots to depict the \textsf{subprocesses} relation in \autoref{fig:typeGraph}.
If the subprocess has no start events, a token will be added to every activity and gateway with no incoming sequence flows.

The bottom rule template generates one rule to delete a terminated process snapshot and adds tokens at each outgoing sequence flow.
Subprocesses are terminated by the termination rule (see section \ref{subsec:instAndTermination}).


% Send/Receive tasks (mentioned/shown with message events later)
\subsection{Gateways}
\autoref{fig:gatewayTemplates} depicts the rule generation templates for parallel and exclusive gateways (see \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}).
% Parallel
A parallel gateway can synchronize and fork the control flow simultaneously.
Thus, one rule is generated that deletes one token from each incoming sequence flow and adds one token to each outgoing sequence flow.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/gateways_template.pdf}
    \caption{Rule generation template for gateways}
    \label{fig:gatewayTemplates}
\end{figure}

% Exclusive --> Exception no incoming flows in sub-processes (token taken from gateway directly)
Exclusive Gateways are triggered by exactly one incoming sequence flow, and exactly one outgoing sequence flow is triggered.
Thus, one rule must be generated for every combination of incoming and outgoing sequence flows.
However, the resulting rule is simple since it only deletes a token from an incoming sequence flow and adds one to an outgoing sequence flow.

% Event-based with different event combinations
% Mention unsupported types?
\subsection{Message Events}
% Message throw
\autoref{fig:messageEventTemplates} depicts the rule generation templates for \textit{message intermediate throw events} and \textit{message intermediate catch events} (\textsf{MITE} and \textsf{MICE} in \autoref{fig:bpmnfeaturesOverview}).
% Message throw with intermediate catch message events
The first rule template describes how MITEs interact with MICEs.
A MITE deletes an incoming token and adds one at each outgoing sequence flow.
In addition, it sends one message to each waiting process by adding it to the incoming messages of the process.
However, sending each message is optional, meaning that if a process is not ready to consume a message immediately, the message is not added.
%This behavior corresponds to the BPMN semantics \cite{objectmanagementgroupBusinessProcessModel2013}.
We implement optional message sending using a nested rule with quantification.
Concretely, we use an optional existential quantifier (see blue dotted rectangle marked with optional in \autoref{fig:messageEventTemplates}) to send a message only if the receiving process runs and is ready to receive it \cite{rensinkNestedQuantificationGraph2006}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/bpmn_semantics-message_templates.pdf}
    \caption{Rule generation templates for message events}
    \label{fig:messageEventTemplates}
\end{figure}

% Message throw with MSEs
The second rule template shows how MITEs trigger new process instances when interacting with \textit{message start events} (MSEs).
For each MSE, a new process snapshot with one token at each outgoing sequence flow is added.
We chose to create a process snapshot immediately rather than creating a message and then consuming this message and creating a process snapshot in a separate rule.
This decision keeps the rule generation simpler and the state space of the \gls*{gt} system smaller.
It is worth noting that a MITE might interact with MICEs and MSEs \textit{simultaneously}.
Thus, the rule generation templates in \autoref{fig:messageEventTemplates} can be mixed, i.e., messages can be sent and processes instantiated by one MITE.
We only separated message throw behavior into two rule templates for presentation purposes.
% Explain the similarity to Send-tasks.
Furthermore, \textit{message end events} and \textit{send tasks} behave similarly regarding message creation and process instantiation.

% Message catch + Receive Task
The third rule template in \autoref{fig:messageEventTemplates} shows the behavior of MICEs.
To trigger a MICE, only one message at an incoming \textit{message flow} is needed.
Thus, one rule is generated for each incoming \textit{message flow}.
The rule template shows that MICEs delete one message and one token, as well as add a token at each outgoing sequence flow.
Furthermore, \textit{receive tasks} behave similarly regarding message consumption.


\section{Model checking BPMN} \label{sec:modelChecking}

Model checking a BPMN model is possible using the generated \gls*{gt} system.
Besides a \gls*{gt} system, a set of temporal properties to be checked, and the atomic propositions used in these properties must be supplied.
An atomic proposition is formalized as a graph and holds in a given state if a match exists from the underlying graph of the proposition to the graph representing the state.
This enables model checking of temporal properties with the defined atomic propositions \cite{kastenbergModelCheckingDynamic2006}.

We differentiate between \textit{general BPMN properties} defined for all BPMN models and \textit{custom properties} tailored towards a particular BPMN model.
We do not consider structural properties (like conformance to the syntax of BPMN) since they can be checked using a standard modeling tool without implementing execution semantics.
We will now give an example of two predefined general BPMN properties and show how they can be checked using our approach.
Then, we describe how custom properties can be defined and checked.

\subsection{General BPMN properties}
\textit{Safeness} and \textit{Soundness} properties are defined for BPMN in \cite{corradiniClassificationBPMNCollaborations2018}.
A BPMN model is \textit{safe} if, during its execution, at most one token occurs along the same sequence flow \cite{corradiniClassificationBPMNCollaborations2018}.
Soundness is further decomposed into (i) \textit{Option to complete}: any running process instance must eventually complete, (ii) \textit{Proper completion}: at the moment of completion, each token of the process instance must be in a different end event, as well as (iii) \textit{No dead activities}: any activity can be executed in at least one process instance \cite{corradiniClassificationBPMNCollaborations2018}.
For example, we will describe how to implement the \textit{Safeness} and \textit{Option to complete} properties.

% Safeness
\textit{Safeness} is specified using the CTL property defined in \eqref{eq:safeness}.
The atomic property \textsf{Unsafe} is true if two tokens of one process snapshot point to the same sequence flow.
Groove rules for all the atomic propositions are included in \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.

% Option to complete
\textit{Option to complete} is specified using the CTL property defined in \eqref{eq:optionToComplete}.
The atomic proposition \textsf{AllTerminated} is true if there exists no process snapshot in the state \textsf{Running}, i.e., all process snapshots are \textsf{Terminated}.

Checking the properties \textit{Safeness}, \textit{Option to Complete}, and \textit{No Dead Activities} is implemented in our tool \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.
The property \textit{Proper Completion} is not yet implemented, but all the information needed can be found in the \gls*{gt} systems state space.

\subsection{Custom properties} \label{subsec:customProperties}
% Defining atomic propositions in BPMN is a novelty.
To make model checking user-friendly, we envision modelers defining atomic propositions in the extended BPMN syntax, i.e., the concrete syntax introduced in \autoref{fig:typeGraph}.
Thus, to define an atomic proposition, a modeler adds process snapshots and tokens to a BPMN model, which we can automatically convert to a graph representing an atomic proposition.

For example, the token distribution shown in \autoref{fig:atomicProposition} defines two running process snapshots with a token at task A.
Differently colored tokens define different process snapshots.
A modeler could use this atomic proposition, for example, to check if, eventually, two processes are executing task A simultaneously by creating an LTL/CTL property.
Thus, a modeler does not need to know the \gls*{gt} semantics used for execution.

However, a modeler must still know the temporal logic, such as LTL and CTL, to express his properties.
In the future, a domain-specific property language for BPMN would further lessen the knowledge required from a modeler \cite{meyersProMoBoxFrameworkGenerating2014}.

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:impl}

% Tool
Our approach is implemented in a web-based tool.
The tool is open-source, publicly available, and does not require any installation \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.
\autoref{fig:implScreenshot} depicts a screenshot of the implemented tool.

First, a modeler creates or uploads a \gls*{bpmn} model.
Then, in the verification section, one can check either \gls*{bpmn}-specific properties or custom CTL properties.
Finally, our tool can generate a \gls*{gt} system for the supplied \gls*{bpmn} model and run model checking in Groove \cite{kastenbergModelCheckingDynamic2006}.
% Evaluation
Furthermore, to evaluate the correctness of our \gls*{hot}, we created a comprehensive test suite, which verifies correct rule generation for the implemented \gls*{bpmn} features \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.
As described in the next section, we also ran a performance benchmark for our approach.

\subsection{Performance benchmark}

Model checking is a useful technique but often falls short in practice due to insufficient performance.
Poor performance might have many reasons, most notably large models leading to state space explosion.
We ran a benchmark for ten different BPMN models from \cite{houhouFirstOrderLogicVerification2022} to assess the performance of our implementation.
The models include realistic business process models (001, 002, and 020) \cite{houhouFirstOrderLogicVerification2022}.

To calculate the average runtime, we used the hyperfine benchmarking tool \cite{peterHyperfine2022} (version 1.15.0), which ran state space exploration for each BPMN model ten times.
The benchmarks were run on Windows 11 (AMD Ryzen 7700X processor, 32 GB RAM) using Groove version 5.8.1 \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}. 

First, we benchmarked our \gls*{hot} for the BPMN models.
The \gls*{hot} took less than one second to generate a \gls*{gt} system for every model.
Thus, the generation of the \gls*{gt} systems is fast enough.
Furthermore, we suspect most of the time is spent writing the \gls*{gt} system to disk.

% State space generation benchmark. Check times reported by Groove. Probably some startup time to read the files etc.
Second, we benchmarked a full state exploration using the resulting ten \gls*{gt} systems, see \autoref{table:stateSpaceBenchmark}.
The exploration takes roughly one second for most of the models.
Only model \textit{020} needs nearly two seconds due to its larger state space.
Furthermore, we estimate that up to one second is spent before state space exploration, most likely reading the \gls*{gt} system files.
For example, Groove reports only 722 ms for state space exploration for model \textit{020}.

We conclude that our approach is sufficiently fast for models of normal size.
In addition, there is still room for optimization, such as avoiding costly I/O to disk.
A more comprehensive benchmark and detailed comparison to other implementations are left for future work.

\section{Related work} \label{sec:relatedWork}
% Van gorp
A BPMN formalization based on in-place \gls*{gt} rules is given in \cite{vangorpVisualTokenbasedFormalization2013}.
The formalization covers a substantial part of the BPMN specification, including complex concepts such as inclusive gateways and compensation.
In addition, the \gls*{gt} rules are visual and thus can be aligned with the informal description of the execution semantics of BPMN.
A key difference to our approach is that the rules in \cite{vangorpVisualTokenbasedFormalization2013} are general and can be applied to any BPMN model, while we generate specific rules for every BPMN model using our \gls*{hot}.
Thus, our approach can be seen as a program specialization compared to \cite{vangorpVisualTokenbasedFormalization2013} since we process a concrete BPMN model before its execution.
However, they do \textit{not} support property checking since their goal is only formalization.

% BProve/Corradini
The tool \textit{BProVe} is based on formal BPMN semantics given in rewriting logic and implemented in the Maude system \cite{corradiniFormalApproachAnalysis2021}.
Using this formal semantics, they can verify custom LTL properties and general BPMN properties, such as Safeness and Soundness.

% fbpmn/Houhou
The verification framework \textsf{fbpmn} uses first-order logic to formalize and check BPMN models \cite{houhouFirstOrderLogicVerification2022}.
This formalization is then realized in the TLA\textsuperscript{+} formal language and can be model-checked using TLC.
Like BProVe, \textsf{fbpmn} allows checking general BPMN properties, such as Safeness and Soundness.
Furthermore, they focus on different communication models besides the standard in the \gls*{bpmn} specification and support time-related constructs.
We currently disregard time-related constructs \cite{duranVerifyingTimedBPMN2017,houhouFirstOrderLogicVerification2022} and data flow \cite{corradiniFormalisingAnimatingMultiple2022,el-saberCMMICMComplianceChecking2015}.

\autoref{tab:supportedfeatures} shows which BPMN features are supported by the approaches mentioned above compared to ours.
The coverage of BPMN features greatly impacts how useful each approach is in practice.
% Summarize the findings and explain them in more detail
Our approach covers most of the \gls*{bpmn} features compared to other current approaches.
Thus, we conclude that our formalization is comprehensive but can still be improved.
In addition, it covers the most important features found in practice since we come close to the feature coverage of popular process engines such as Camunda\footnote{\url{https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/reference/bpmn20/}}.

\section{Conclusion \& future work} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper makes two main practical contributions.
First, we conceptualized a new approach utilizing a \gls*{hot} to formalize the semantics of behavioral languages.
Our approach moves complexity from the \gls*{gt} rules to the rule templates making up the \gls*{hot}.
Furthermore, the approach can be applied to any behavioral language if one can define its \textit{state structure} and identify its \textit{state-changing elements}.

Second, we apply our approach to BPMN, resulting in a comprehensive formalization regarding feature coverage (compared to the literature and industrial process engines) that supports checking behavioral properties.
Furthermore, our contribution resulted in an open-source web-based tool to make our ideas easily accessible to other researchers and practitioners.

Future work targets both of our main contributions.
First, we plan a detailed comparison of our \gls*{hot} approach with an approach with fixed rules.
It will be interesting to investigate how the two approaches differ, for example, in runtime during state space generation.
Second, we aim to improve our formalization and the resulting tool in multiple ways.
We intend to extend our formalization to support the remaining few BPMN features used in practice and want to turn the modeling environment of our tool into an interactive simulation environment driven by our formal semantics.
In addition, we can use this environment to visualize potential counterexamples of behavioral properties.

\section{Appendix}


This section shows examples of our tool checking general BPMN properties.
Our tool and the example models are available as artifacts \cite{krauterArtifactsICGT2023}.

\subsection{Safeness example}
\autoref{fig:unsafeSample} shows a screenshot of the tool detecting an unsafe situation.
Unfortunately, Groove does not provide a counterexample when running CTL model checking through the console.
Thus, we cannot highlight where the model is unsafe.
In this case, the sequence flow \textit{Unsafe} is unsafe.

The exclusive gateway merges the sequence flows but does not synchronize.
Thus, the outgoing sequence flow can hold two tokens, and Activity C is executed twice.
This could be a simple mistake not obvious to people unfamiliar with the BPMN execution semantics.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{artifacts/unsafe_sample.png}
    \caption{Screenshot of the tool detecting an unsafe situation}
    \label{fig:unsafeSample}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Option to complete example}
\autoref{fig:optionToCompleteSample} shows a screenshot of the tool checking the \textit{Option to complete} property.

The parallel gateway cannot synchronize since no split has happened before.
Thus, the process cannot terminate.
Again, this could be a simple mistake not obvious to people unfamiliar with the BPMN execution semantics.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{artifacts/option_to_complete_sample.png}
    \caption{Screenshot of the tool checking \textit{Option to complete}}
    \label{fig:optionToCompleteSample}
\end{figure}

\subsection{No dead activities example}
\autoref{fig:deadSample} shows a screenshot of the tool detecting a dead activity.
Activity C is \textit{dead}, which is highlighted when checking for dead activities.

The parallel gateway is incorrect since it cannot synchronize two sequence flows that never split.
This could be a simple mistake not obvious to people unfamiliar with the BPMN execution semantics.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{artifacts/dead_sample.png}
    \caption{Screenshot of the tool detecting a dead activity}
    \label{fig:deadSample}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion}

All these examples were rather simple and boiled down to the wrong gateway being used.
However, in practice, erroneous situations might be much more complex when multiple processes communicate using messages, signals, and other events.
Checking properties can be integrated into the model editor or added to CI/CD pipelines to catch errors as soon as possible.
